I would like to feature some of the components that i worked on -->

- Generic lookup (Object name, number of fields to be displayed and their order are customizable, restrict record based on record ids)

- Flow screen components (Update any record ,path progress indicates the progress which is integrated with the LWC buttons, custom file uploader)

- Custom file uploader (custom file uploader - file type, number     of files to be uploaded, preview for uploaded files are customizable)
